        “Using a consultant mindset, Brian takes great pride in finding creative
        solutions to complex problems. I have seen him work tirelessly to find a
        new angle or a new approach that will both meet the financial needs of
        the company and the personal needs of his customers. He is tactful and
        delicate in the way he positions bad news and strives to share the
        silver lining in any difficult situation. A depth of knowledge and
        real-life experience allows Brian to empathize with his customers and
        speak to them in a way that is unique and engaging. His ability to
        deliver consistently strong results make him an asset to any team.” –
