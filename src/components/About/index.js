        <p>With over 13 years of professional experience in business intel and reporting analytics while working in the telecommunications and technology industries, Brian King has taken a pause in his career to pursue a new career in web development, and is currently living the "coding-life," as he regularly quips to friends and family. During the crucible of learning to code while enrolled in an intensive boot camp curriculum, Brian learned firsthand the value of great online resources, clean code, and the rather surprising willingness of the developer community to share and give back to the profession that they love. This brief tutorial is Brian's small contribution to that community that has shared so much with him already, and is hopefully to be the first of many more in the future.</p>
